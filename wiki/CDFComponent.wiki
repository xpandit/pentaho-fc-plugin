#summary This page contains information about the CDF FusionChartComponent.

= Summary =
The Fusion Chart Plugin provides CDF component that can be used like any other CDF component. 

= How to use =
To use this component you have to create a CDF component with the following type: "FusionChartComponent".

When defining a chart in the context of a dashboard you can define the chart parameters in a .xFusion file (local properties) or define them in the metalayer (instance properties). This two ways of defining the chart parameters can be associated to the FusionChart component's by setting the _path_ property with the .xFusion file path and by setting the _chartDefinition_ property with the metalayer, respectively. You can see a chart definition bellow and find some examples in the following path _bi-developers/fusion-samples/Dashboards_. 
The global properties file stored on the plugin's root folder is still loaded at the beginning as in a standalone chart.

            postExecution: function(){
            }
