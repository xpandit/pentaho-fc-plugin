# Introduction #
[Xpand IT](http://xpand-it.com/) implemented a [Pentaho](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/) platform plugin that allows rendering [FusionCharts](http://www.fusioncharts.com/). This plugin enables using FusionCharts as an alternative to the other charting libraries that are currently provided with the platform.
It can be used to display eye catching charts on the user console and on [CDF](http://www.webdetails.pt/ctools/cdf/) and [CDE](http://www.webdetails.pt/ctools/cde/) dashboards as well. Despite being shipped with FusionCharts free, the plugin also works with the licensed version. For a complete description check this [link](http://www.xpand-it.com/fusioncharts).

# Acknowledgments #
We would like to thank David Lai that some time ago made freely available, on his [blog](http://davidlai101.com/blog/), the code that we now used as a foundation for the integration. Since no major re-factoring was necessary we decided to keep for now the original class packages.
